## 1. What is efficient

In general, efficient Python code is the one:
- executing quickly for the task at hand
- minimizing the memory footprint
- following Python's coding style principles (i.e. PEP)

## 2. Building with built-ins

### Python built-in components

Built-in components are referred as the Python Standard Library, and the library comes with every Python installation. 

Some built-in components include: 
- Built-in types (e.g., `list`, `tuple`, `set`)
- Built-in functions (e.g., `print()`, `len()`, `range()`)
- Built-in modules (e.g., `os`, `sys`, `itertools`)

Built-ins have been optimized to work within the Python language itself, so using them is recommended if exists.

### Useful built-ins: range()

It returns a sequence of the given number between the given range.

#### Syntax

> `range(start, stop, step)`

#### Parameters

- start: an integer specifying at which position to start (default: 0)
- stop: element at which numbers in sequence have to end (exclusive)
- step: an integer specifying the incrementation (default: 1)

#### Return value

The sequence of the given number between the given range

#### Example

```python
# Create a list of people that arrived at a party we're hosting.
names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']

# Create an empty list to store the indexed list.
indexed_names = []

# Use a for loop to get the indexed list.
for i in range(len(names)):
    index_name = (i, names[i])
    indexed_names.append(index_name)

print(indexed_names)

# output
[(0, 'Jerry'), (1, 'Kramer'), (2, 'Elaine'), (3, 'George'), (4, 'Newman')]
```

### Useful built-ins: enumerate()

It takes a collection and returns it as an indexed object.

#### Syntax

> `enumerate(iterable, start = 0)`

#### Parameters

- iterable: an iterable object
- start: an integer specifying the start number of the enumerate object (default: 0)


#### Example
```python
# Create an empty list to store the indexed list.
indexed_names = []

# Rewrite the for loop to use enumerate
for i, name in enumerate(names):
    index_name = (i, name)
    indexed_names.append(index_name)

# Rewrite the above for loop using list comprehension
indexed_names_comp = [(i, name) for i, name in enumerate(names)]

# Unpack an enumerate object with a starting index of one
indexed_names_unpack = [*enumerate(names, start = 1)]

print(indexed_names_unpack)

# output 
[(1, 'Jerry'), (2, 'Kramer'), (3, 'Elaine'), (4, 'George'), (5, 'Newman')]
```

### Useful built-ins: map()

It returns a map object of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable.

#### Syntax
> `map(function, iterable)`

#### Parameters

- function: the function to execute for each item
- iterable: a sequence

#### Example
```python
# Create a list of people that arrived at a party we're hosting.
names = ['Jerry', 'Kramer', 'Elaine', 'George', 'Newman']
names_uppercase = []

# Use a for loop to convert all the letters in each name to uppercase.
for name in names:
    names_uppercase.append(name.upper())

# Use a map function to convert each letter to uppercase.
names_map = map(str.upper, names)

# Unpack names_map into a list
names_uppercase = [*names_map]
```

## 3. The power of NumPy arrays

### Overview

- NumPy arrays provide a fast and memory efficient alternative to Python lists.
- NumPy arrays are homogeneous, which means that the items in an array must be of the same type. 

### Broadcasting

It refers to a NumPy Arrayâ€™s ability to vectorize operations, so they are efficiently performed over the entire arrays.

#### Example
```python
# Create a 2-D array 
nums = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

# Use a for loop to multiply each element by 2
nums_dbl1 = []
for num in nums:
    nums_dbl1.append(num * 2)

# Use a broadcasting to double element efficiently.
nums_dbl2 = nums * 2
```

### Boolean indexing

It returns an array object of Boolean type, and this will be useful in filtering desired element values.

#### Example
```python
nums = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Use a for loop to filter elements greater than six.
nums_filtered1 = []
for num in nums:
    if num > 2:
        nums_filtered1.append(num)

# Use a boolean indexing to filter elements greater than six efficiently.
nums_filtered2 = nums[nums > 2]
```
